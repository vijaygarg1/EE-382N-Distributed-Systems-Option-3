\section{Introduction}
Students in EE 382V are required to scribe lecture notes for one lecture.
These lecture notes will be done using the document processing system called Latex.
We have posted the file {\em scribe.tex} on the Canvas system. You can run {\tt pdflatex}
on that file to generate {\em scribe.pdf}. The remaining document shows usage of
some of the commands in Latex.

\section{All Pairs Shortest Paths}

The naive and obvious solution to All Pairs Shortest Path(APSP) problem is to
run a Single Source Shortest Path algorithm from each starting vertex
$v$.  If the graph has arbitrary edge weights, it takes the Bellman-Ford
algorithm $O(|E||V|^2)$ time to solve APSP.  But there
are better approaches.

\subsection{Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Dynamic Programming}

Label the vertices $1,2,\ldots,n$.
Define $d^{(k)}(i,j)$ to be the length of a shortest path from $i$
to $j$, using intermediate vertices from \{$1,2,\ldots,k$\} only.
Obviously, $d^{(n)}(i,j)$ is the full problem.  

\ldots

\section{Transitive Closure}

Our goal is to achieve running time $O(M(n)\log n)$ for APSP where
$M(n)$ is the time for $n\times n$ matrix multiplication.  Let's see
if we can achieve this for a simpler but related problem, namely
{\it Transitive Closure\/}:

\ldots
