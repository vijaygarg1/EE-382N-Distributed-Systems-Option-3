\section{Lamport Clocks}
The motivation for this is that we need some mechanism to tell us $e \rightarrow f$.

\begin{definition}\label{def:logicalclock}
A map $C$ is a logical clock if $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $e \rightarrow f \Rightarrow c(e) < c(f)$
\end{definition}


Notice in Definition \ref{def:logicalclock} that $C$ is a unidirectional material conditional,
not bidirectional.
Numbers should monotonically increase with a process
Every process should send a number when it receives an event - take $max(P_1, P_n)$ then add 1.

\subsection{Lamport Clock Algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Calculate a logical clock for a distributed system}
\begin{algorithmic}
% \Comment{For \underline{$P_i$}}
  \State $c \gets 0$
\Comment{\underline{Initialization}}
  \State $c \gets c+1$
\Comment{\underline{on internal event}}
  \State $c \gets c+1$
\Comment{\underline{on send event}}
  \State Send c with message
  \State $c \gets max(c, d) + 1$
\Comment{\underline{on receive of message with d as clock}}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

This algorithm will always return a logical clock which will monotonically increase with events in the system.

\section{Vector Clocks}

\subsection{Motivation}
Using the simple Lamport Clock, we cannot infer that e happened before f.
That is because of the unidirectional implication in the definition.
To get a complete ordering, can we come up with a map where
\begin{definition}\label{def:vectorclockconstraint}
$V: E \rightarrow \mathbb{N}^n $ s.t. $e \rightarrow f \Leftrightarrow V(e) < V(f)$

\end{definition}
Notice in Definition \ref{def:vectorclock} that we have if and only if.
This means that if we have the values $V(e)$ and $V(f)$, we can determine whether e happened before f.


\begin{definition}\label{def:vectorclock}
  $ x, y $ are vectors in n-dimension \\
  \[ \forall i: x[i] \le y[i] \wedge \exists j: x[j] < y[j] \]
  % \[ \wedge \]
  % \[ \exists j: x[j] < y[j] \]
\end{definition}
As an example of how this comparison works, $(2, 7, 9) < (3, 7, 9)$ and $(2, 7, 9) || (3, 5, 2)$.
To map natural numbers to poset, you need vectors. You cannot do it with a scalars.
As an example of how this works,

\subsection{Algorithm for Vector Clock}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{An algorithm to track vector clocks}
\begin{algorithmic}
  \State \underline{$P_i$::} V: array[1 \ldots n] of int
  \State \underline{init:} all 0's except V[i] = 1;
  \State $V[i] \gets V[i] + 1$
\Comment{\underline{for internal event}}
  \State $V[i] \gets V[i] + 1$
\Comment{\underline{for send event}}
  \State Send V with message
  \State $V \gets max(V, W)$
\Comment{\underline{for receive event with vector W}}
  \State $V[i] \gets V[i] + 1$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{proof}
The proof that this algorithm returns a consistent clock which gives a total order is taken in two parts. \\

\vspace{2mm}

{\bf 1$^{st}$ Part: $e \rightarrow f \Rightarrow V(e) < V(f)$}\\
\underline{Proof}\\
This is proven by the vector increasing along each edge in the system diagram.\\

\vspace{5mm}

{\bf 2$^{nd}$ Part: $e \not\to f \Rightarrow V(e) \not< V(f)$} \\
\underline{Proof} \\
$e \not\to f \Rightarrow $ there is no path from e to f $\Rightarrow V(f)[i] < V(e)[i]$ \\
e is on $P_i \wedge$ f is on $P_j \Rightarrow V(e) \not< V(f)$
\end{proof}
\underline{Explanation} $P_2$ does not know about $P_1$, so $P_1$`s values for $P_1$ must be larger.

\subsection{Directly Precedes}
If we only care about direct messages, i.e., no transitivity,
we can get away with only sending the component for the sending process.
Each process still stores a full vector with an element for each process.

% \section{Introduction}
% Students in EE 382V are required to scribe lecture notes for one lecture.
% These lecture notes will be done using the document processing system called Latex.
% We have posted the file {\em scribe.tex} on the Canvas system. You can run {\tt pdflatex}
% on that file to generate {\em scribe.pdf}. The remaining document shows usage of
% some of the commands in Latex.

% \section{All Pairs Shortest Paths}

% The naive and obvious solution to All Pairs Shortest Path(APSP) problem is to
% run a Single Source Shortest Path algorithm from each starting vertex
% $v$.  If the graph has arbitrary edge weights, it takes the Bellman-Ford
% algorithm $O(|E||V|^2)$ time to solve APSP.  But there
% are better approaches.

% \subsection{Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Dynamic Programming}

% Label the vertices $1,2,\ldots,n$.
% Define $d^{(k)}(i,j)$ to be the length of a shortest path from $i$
% to $j$, using intermediate vertices from \{$1,2,\ldots,k$\} only.
% Obviously, $d^{(n)}(i,j)$ is the full problem.

% \ldots

% \section{Transitive Closure}

% Our goal is to achieve running time $O(M(n)\log n)$ for APSP where
% $M(n)$ is the time for $n\times n$ matrix multiplication.  Let's see
% if we can achieve this for a simpler but related problem, namely
% {\it Transitive Closure\/}:
